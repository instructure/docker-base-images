# Introduction
Your one-stop-shop for Instructure official Docker/Ruby love. If you
need ruby (2.1 or 2.2) in Docker but don't need web services (we've
got `instructure-ruby-passenger` for that) you're in the right place.
Batteries (finicky C libs, see Dockerfile for full listing) are
included, so drop your app in (we suggest /usr/src/app) and start hacking.
